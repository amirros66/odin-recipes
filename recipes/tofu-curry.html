    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a quick, easy recipe resulting in the most delicious tofu curry you may have ever tasted.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 inch piece of ginger</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cashews</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves</li>
        <li>14 oz block of tofu</li>
        <li>coriander</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Place all the ingredients, except the vegetable oil, tofu, butter, cilantro and salt, into a blender and blitz into a very smooth paste.</li> 
          <li>Heat the oil in a wide saucepan or wok. Add the tomato-onion paste and cook it, covered, over a medium-high flame, stirring frequently, until the moisture is mostly gone, the paste looks darker, and shimmers with oil droplets. The paste should look quite sticky at this point and should not taste raw. This step should take you anywhere from 10-15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add 2-3 cups of water or vegetable stock, depending on the thickness you want for your curry, along with the tofu cubes. Add salt, stir to mix everything, bring back to a boil and cover and cook another five minutes. Stir in the vegan butter.</li>
          <li>Serve hot or warm, garnished with cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
